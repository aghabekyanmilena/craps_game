# Dice Rolling Game
    This Python program simulates a dice rolling game. In the game, the player rolls two dice and based on the sum of the two dice, different outcomes are determined.
## Rules of the Game
    The player rolls two dice.
    If the sum of the two dice is 7 or 11, the player wins.
    If the sum is 2, 3, or 12 (known as "craps"), the player loses.
    If the sum is any other number, it becomes the "goal" number.
    To win, the player must roll the dice until they get the goal number again.
    If the player rolls a 7 before rolling the goal number, they lose!
